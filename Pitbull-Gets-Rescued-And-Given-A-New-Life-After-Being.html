        <h1>Pitbull Gets Rescued And Given A New Life After Being Neglected And Abused For Nearly A Lifetime</h1>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prepare to get tissues ready as this story will make you cry. This is the story of Norman, a pit bull dog who was neglected and abused in ten years. When rescuers from AMA Animal Rescue found him, his skin was suffered from infections, covered in scabs and sparse patches of fur. He was so malnourished that everyone could count every bone on his body. He couldn’t stand due to being painful and weak. Although he had a slim chance of survival, the rescuers refused to give up on him and did everything they could to save him.</p>

<p>They immediately took him to their vet clinic, where he was given all medical treatment and care that he needed. Veterinarians at Noah’s Ark checked on him and found that he was mostly blind and deaf. He suffered two types of skin diseases and a severe case of arthritis. The vets tried their best to save his life, but they didn’t know if he would survive. But every passing day, Norman proved to everyone that he never gave up and wanted to have a better life.</p>

<p>After months of care, love, and intensive medical treatments, Norman gained his health and was ready to move to his foster home. And with the help of the rescuers and his foster mom, Norman finally found his forever home that he desired. He now lives a happy life with his human who loves him so much. Hopefully, his whole life will be full of joy and love.</p>
