        <h1>Complete stranger steps up to pay for expensive surgery to save a dog’s life </h1>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A good pet can mean the world to someone and be their most beloved companion during the hardest of times. But giving a pet all the care they need can be expensive, especially when it comes to medical bills, leaving even the most devoted dog owners struggling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was the case for one woman, who was faced with the heartbreaking possibility of losing her sole companion after receiving a hefty medical bill. But thankfully, one guardian angel stepped up to help.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like many people, Teresa Boeklem, of Westminster, Colorado, was personally devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic: the coronavirus claimed the lives of both her parents and her aunt, according to <a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/womans-2-year-old-dog-saved-by-complete-stranger-who-paid-for-vet-bills">The Denver Channel</a>. She also suffered a miscarriage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among all this loss, she found solace in her beloved dog, a 2-year-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Chloe. “She comforted me through some of the hardest times in my life,” Teresa told the Denver Channel.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in July, she was devastated after finding Chloe unresponsive. The dog had a medical condition later diagnosed as an autoimmune blood disorder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a visit to the vet, she found out that her beloved dog could only be saved by a blood transfusion procedure that would cost her over two thousand dollars. Unable to afford such an expense, she was heartbroken to think she might lose her beloved companion, too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I looked up at God and I said, ‘really?’ … ‘now Chloe too?’ I said, ‘I can’t do this anymore. I can’t, I can’t.’ I said, ‘I feel extremely alone in this world.’”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But soon, her prayers were answered: after so much loss and devastation, she finally got a miracle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After sharing news about Chloe’s condition online, a complete stranger contacted her — and to her amazement, offered to pay for the dog’s treatment!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I started hysterically crying,” Teresa told The Denver Channel. “I mean I could not believe it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The stranger, who is currently anonymous to the public, paid for Chloe’s blood transfusion and all the follow-up visits to the vet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The incredible act of kindness saved Chloe’s life, and she is now doing great. It also changed Teresa’s life, inspiring her after such a difficult year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The takeaway for me is to pay it forward,” she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bless this kind stranger for doing such a selfless act and saving this dog’s life. After Teresa lost so much, we’re glad she still has Chloe by her side.</strong></p>
